Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning JS libraries and building projects! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Learning React and Astro**: At this point i have used react to create several prototypes that still need polishing. Find these projects on my Github repo, https://github.com/The-Oracle-AT . Now i am starting an astro project to create a portfolio that will get me a job as a web developer or tech software professional.

2. **Making Pages**: I have been playing with languages like Java, JS, Python, C++ in my free time and using R and SQL in the university projects i had. I chose JS because of the benefits that come with a popular language and i believe that everything will be
cloud based in the future, so i do not think a well established and used langauge like JS is going anywhere anytime soon.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: I used Astro for the webpage and markdown to document this post. and i think i'm going to stick with it considering that i can used any (well established) JS framework that i learn simply by adding it.

4. **Comments**: I got used to react components now that i am using html again this much,
it feels a bit like i am back to using vanilla JavaScript.
